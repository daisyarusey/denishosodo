                <h5 class="text-blue ">PROFILE</h5>
                <p> I am the
                    <b>immediate former National Vice Chairman of ICPAK</b>, a role I held till 2019, during which time the current 2019-2021 4- Pillar ICPAK Strategic plan was developed, all branches had physical offices established, significant gains
                    were made through the amendments to the Accountants Act which expanded the scope of Accountancy offering new areas of practice to many members and the bar was raised and objectivity & transparency achieved in ICPAK honours such as
                    Fellowships and commendations and appointments to internal organs and external Boards.</p>
                <p>I have wide and deep experience in the field of Accountancy spanning over 20 years.</p>
                <p>I am the
                    <b>Internal Audit Director at Safaricom Limited</b>. Prior to joining Safaricom, I worked at
                    <b>PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC)</b> for several years, serving clients in different industries from Kenya and United Kingdom offices. I left PwC as <b>Risk Assurance Services Director</b> leading teams focusing on the provision of
                    Business Controls Advisory Services to clients across Africa. </p>
                <p>I serve in the Board of Kenya Paediatric Research Consortium (KEPRECON) as the Treasurer and has previously been a member of the Audit committee of a state corporation amongst other positions of trust and responsibility.</p>
                <p>My love for Accountancy began in High School at the height of the “Goldenberg scandal” when I chose to study Accounting with an informed belief that skills acquired would help <b>combat corruption in our Country</b>. Thereafter, I enrolled
                    in Strathmore’s School of Accountancy to develop this passion into a career, <b>keeping the faith</b> that Accountancy could <b>change our Country</b>. My dedication to the profession and commitment to public service was consolidated
                    during my time at the University of Nairobi pursuing a degree in Commerce. The fulfilling career journey since then has <b>reaffirmed my faith</b> in this profession and the many opportunities we can open for our members if we raise
                    ICPAK’s profile to be the <b>champion of Financial Accountability in our Country</b>. I deeply believe Accountants can and must lead the line to prevent the “Goldenbergs” and <b>change our Country</b>.</p>
                <p>I am married to Mary and blessed with three school going children, the people who remind me every day why we must never give up till we succeed. We must <b>keep the Faith</b>.</p>

                <p>I am the immediate past National Vice Chairman of the Institute.</p>
                <p>I was elected to the Council of the Institute by members in 2017 and took on the noble task with passion and dedication, seeking in every opportunity, to raise the bar. Because of my commitment and proven outcomes in Council, my colleagues
                    affirmed their trust in me and my vision for our profession by electing me Vice -Chair in 2018.</p>
                <p>I was, during my time in Council, the convener of the Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee as well as the Internal Auditors Sub-committee. I was also the co-convener of the Practitioners Development Committee. Following the successful
                    amendments to the Accountants Act in 2018, I was appointed to chair the special committee on Implementation of the amendments to ensure full operationalisation of these significant changes to the profession in Kenya.</p>
                <p>Prior to joining Council, I was the co-convener of the Audit, Risk and Compliance committee of the Institute. I often publish articles in the mainstream and social media to promote and defend the profession and works with institutions
                    of higher learning to promote the interest in various fields of Accountancy.</p>

                <p class="mt-5 ">Every so often in our journey, we come to a junction of significant decision, where we are called upon to choose between renewal to thrive and grow or status quo to barely survive. ICPAK has been on this pedestal since we turned 40. The
                    institute has since its founding made great strides, thanks to the sacrifice and service of many who have offered their resources, time, talent and skill. We honour them all and face the future with hope because of this past.</p>
                <p>Now it’s our turn to renew the Institute by making it a sustainably member centric, credible, respected and influential professional body that upholds Public Interest. It’s all about YOU, the member. With proven moral courage to make a
                    difference, I seek to raise the profile of ICPAK and the profession and be the Accountability voice in the country and thereby create and protect opportunities for members, for it’s all about YOU. I will operationalise, in public interest,
                    the Effective regulation of the profession, supporting all members in the discharge of their work whilst sanctioning firmly and promptly all malpractices to restore and keep the trust in Accountancy, for it’s all about YOU. I will
                    transform the service delivery to members through digitisation, improvement in quality of services, reduction in costs of CPD events and more engagement with all categories of members, for it’s all about YOU. This year, to support
                    you through the Covid pandemic, I will offer at least two free online CPD events to ensure a member can obtain required CPD hours without costs, for it’s all about YOU.
                </p>
                <p>I humbly request for your vote to serve you as CHAIRMAN, for it’s all about YOU</p>
